# ADayWithArcueid
Repository of the game "A day with Arcueid", maded with the tool "Paradox Engine", both developed by me.
You can access the game here: https://deadlysmile.itch.io/a-day-with-arcueid

For now it's only avalible in spanish. English coming soon.

It's recommended delete the "Save" folder and play the "Init" scene the first time. The Init scene will create the save files again.
