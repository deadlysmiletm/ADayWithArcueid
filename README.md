# ADayWithArcueid
Repository of the game "A day with Arcueid", maded with the tool "Paradox Engine", both developed by me.
You can access the game here: https://deadlysmile.itch.io/a-day-with-arcueid

For now it's only avalible in spanish. English coming soon.

It's recommended delete the "Save" folder and play the "Init" scene the first time. The Init scene will create the save files again.

Note: The "Paradox Engine" in the next "A day with..." will get a Core update with a full modular architecture.

## Paradox Engine features:
1- Visual novel creation with an easy visual node system, without knowledge of programming.
2- A full modular architecture. You can easily extend and create your own modules without edit the existent code (in development).
3- Scriptable events that can be executed from a graph.
4- Pool pattern tool for an easy initilization.
5- Options menu pre-configured and an automatic save options system.
6- Localization manager with scriptable object architecture. You can edit in the internal editor window or export it as a JSON file, and then reimport it translated.
7- Save system integrated (in development).
8- Skip scenes system (in development).
